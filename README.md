# logentries_arduino
An example of how to push data to logentries.com from an arduino.

##Hardware
The example code makes use of an adafruit CC3000 wifi sheild to provide network connectivity. Either the sheild https://www.adafruit.com/products/1491 or the breakout board https://www.adafruit.com/products/1469 will work.

##logentries.com
You will need to create a logentries account and setup a Token-Based Input so that this code will work. An example of doing this can be found here: https://logentries.com/doc/input-token/
